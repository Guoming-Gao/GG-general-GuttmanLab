Refactor: Whole-genome Nanopore pipeline with clear naming and documentation

- Rename scripts with numbered workflow convention (01-07)
  * 01_fastq_quality_metrics.py (was fastq_qc_new.py)
  * 02_align_to_genome.py (was align_mode1.py)
  * 03_extract_snps_from_vcf.py (was extract_snps.py)
  * 04_quantify_alleles.py (was quantify_mode1.py)
  * 05_plot_stoichiometry_heatmap.py (was plot_snp_heatmap.py)
  * 06_compare_multiple_datasets.py (from legacy)
  * 07_generate_summary_report.py (from legacy)
  * trim_umi_adapters.py (was trim_mode2.py)

- Remove legacy code (15 files in scripts/legacy/)
  * Deleted obsolete alignment, QC, and diagnostic scripts
  * Preserved and refactored compare_datasets.py and generate_reports.py

- Add comprehensive README with usage examples
  * Step-by-step workflow for Mode 1 (no UMI)
  * Installation requirements and conda environment
  * Output file structure and descriptions
  * Note on experimental Mode 2 (UMI) limitations

- Delete obsolete notebooks and documentation
  * comparative_pipeline.ipynb
  * pipeline.ipynb
  * current_pipeline_walkthrough.md
  * research_output.md
  * nano_amplicon_pipeline.py (monolithic old script)
  * report_style.css

- Implement Mode 1 complete workflow:
  * FASTQ QC with N50 and length distributions
  * Whole-genome alignment (minimap2)
  * VCF-based SNP extraction (101 B6/Cast SNPs)
  * Per-read allelic quantification
  * Stoichiometry heatmap visualization
  * Multi-dataset comparison
  * Automated report generation
